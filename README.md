## 📖 Project Description

This project is an interactive tip calculator. It allows users to calculate the tip amount and the total amount to pay per person, splitting the total cost of the bill.

The design follows a *mobile-first* approach and is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

### Features

* Enter the total bill amount.
* Select a predefined tip percentage (5%, 10%, 15%, 25%, 50%).
* Enter a custom tip percentage.
* Specify the number of people to split the bill between.
* View the calculated results in real-time:
    * Tip Amount (per person).
    * Total Amount (per person).
* Form validation (e.g., cannot divide by zero).
* A "Reset" button that clears all inputs and results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
